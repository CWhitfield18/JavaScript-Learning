In the example:

      document.write('Good afternoon!');

there exist the object 'document' which represents the entire webpage, the member operator '.' and the method 'write()' of the object
'document' which allows new content to be added to the page in place of the <script> element. In this particular example the parameter of
the 'write()' method is 'Good afternoon!' The latter is what shall be written into the webpage upon running the code.

Also note, the placement of the <script> element within HTML code dictate where the js will appear on the webpage. This can additionally
affect the loadinng time for the page!
