# Learning JavaScript

The contents of this repository are dedicated to the learning of the JavaScript language.

Some rules to live by:

Use https://raw.githack.com/CWhitfield18/JavaScript-Learning/master/01/add-content.html to test code.

Keep images, css, and js in proprietary folders with the html file in the parent folder over all.
